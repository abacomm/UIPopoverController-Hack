# UIPopoverController-Hack

Runtime implementation to allow `UIPopoverController` on iPhone apps. 

## Implementation

By default, Popovers are available for iPad apps only. This is a category on `UIPopoverController` class, that overrides the standard implementation of `_popoversDisabled` to make Popovers available for use on iPhone apps. 

This is for demonstration purpose. The best approach for this probably is change the implementation of `_popoversDisabled` using Method Swizzling.

Also, this probably won’t be accepted by "Apple's Private API Validator" when submitting binary to AppStore. For Enterprise distributions it must be fine.
